    \citet{sanchez12} In fact, as explained by Goetz \& Koeppen (1992a),    there are only 4 possible ways to cre- ate a radial abundance gradient:    (1) A radial variation of the ini- tial mass function (IMF); (2) A    variation of the stellar yields with galactocentric radius; (3) A star    formation rate (SFR) changing with the radius; (4) A gas infall rate    variable with radius.  The first possibility is not usually considered as    probable, and the second one is already included in modern models, that    adopt metallicity dependent stellar yields.
