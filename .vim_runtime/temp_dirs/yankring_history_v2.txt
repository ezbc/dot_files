Difficult concepts to address, does nicely with Hawking radiation, but not clear on how it relates to sonolum.Would have liked a little better description, or clearer expression for calculating amount of energy that reaches Jupiter vs earth. Otherwise, good!Has equation and figures, but not sure what calculation was done by student. Only one reference is referred to in the text.Overall, strong paper. A few grammatical errors.  Kepler's 3rd law was used incorrectly- said p of Mars = 1.88 AU.No citations in text, no figure.  A few grammatical errors.Well written, good used of figures and equation. Could have had stronger stronger argument towards astronomy.Has 3 references, but no authors in biblio. so cites website titles in paper.  Nice description of how ism affects light travel, but not clear if ism refers to material within galaxies, inbetween galaxies, or both.No images or plots, a bit repetitive with 'limitations' with a couple confusing sentences. Not sure what was meant with 3rd HST limitation.Does not cite figures, or use references in text.  Has an equation that says T=T, not clear what calculation was done. Rather jumbled both in science and writing. Missing figure.  Makes big assumptions where it was unclear if there I'd strong scientific evidence to back it up. Interesting discussion!No calculation. Does not cite references in text. Liked diacritics with figure!No calculation. Poor transitions, gets off topic with multiverse description.No figure.No reference for image.  Doesn't really have a conclusionNo clear description of how the calculation relates to argument in the text. A few paragraphs are confusing and repetitive.Fluffy writing that didn't hold too much scientific content.Nicely written and easy to follow, but lacks conclusion.  One misstep early on science-wise: said humans experience less gravity in space because it's a vacuum.  Topic didn't have strong connection with astronomy.Not clear what the student actually calculated.mDoes not cite figures.Only cites 2 references within text.  But everything else if very nicely done.Nicely written, and an interesting topic, but it was missing some discussion about astronomy science.Repetitive writing with a few gram. errors. Does not give citations for figures.Student doesn't seem to understand the difference between radiation and high energy particles, or how these two things each interact with the earth's atmosphere and magnetic fields.  Use of boltzmann's equation did not make sense.Missing a figure. Didn't cite references in text in the usual fashion.Has an equation but doesn't calculate anything.  A few spots where writing was unclear, and science seemed a little loose. Doesn't cite figures and only refers to 2 references in the text.Includes website address for figures but does not include them in the references section.Does not include references next to figures and does not cite all references within text.  Organization was a little heavy with only 3 paragraphs.Don't understand the calculation. Apprecitiated the text with the figure. Connection to astronomy is weak.Lots of writing errors that made it difficult to follow the paper.  Does I not cite references for figure. Felt more like a history lesson than a discussion about an astronomical topic.No reference for tables in text. Handful of gram. errors that made paper difficult to follow.No figure, not sure the student calculated anythingNo calculation.  Hard topic to do well in 800words!Has figure, but too small to see anything.  Science concepts sound a little weak.Great paper, a few minor writing errors. Tied back to astronomy at the end.Didn't have strong connection to astronomy science. Missing citations in text.Nice paper.Looks like calculation was copy pasted from somewhere. Hard to tell if student understood calculation.  Does not cite figures.No references on figures.  Calculation did produce correct estimate of sputniks orbital radius.Creative and clear analysis, well written. No calculations, main point not fully developed, well researchedWell supported argument, could have made connection to astro. more clear.Well written, well researched, clearly and thoroughly analyzed.Some quotes not cited in text, but overall a thoughtful analysis. No in-text citations or figures.

Stellar paper.No calculation, more of a list of facts than an analysis.Interesting topic, but needs a bit more in-depth analysis."typos presentone of key arguments, light will be bent more by the existence of extra dimensions, is not explained until end of paper, better to pose the theory first, then provide observational testsotherwise progression of ideas is well thought out, providing hypothesis, then discussing how to test itall parameters in the equation are not explained"Needs scientific analysis and at least one calculation.Organized paper, interesting topic.Organized paper, interesting topic. Needs a bit more in-depth scientific analysis.No figure, no works cited page, writing style fluffy.

    \citet{dicintio14} used simulations. The main result is a clear dependence    of the inner slope of the dark matter density profile on the    stellar-to-halo mass ratio. At higher star formation efficiencies dark    matter profiles become flatter.     \citet{dicintio14b} introduce a mass dependent density profile to describe    the distribution of dark matter within galaxies, which takes into account    the stellar-to-halo mass dependence of the response of dark matter to    baryonic processes,V

    \citet{sanchez12} In fact, as explained by Goetz \& Koeppen (1992a),    there are only 4 possible ways to cre- ate a radial abundance gradient:    (1) A radial variation of the ini- tial mass function (IMF); (2) A    variation of the stellar yields with galactocentric radius; (3) A star    formation rate (SFR) changing with the radius; (4) A gas infall rate    variable with radius.  The first possibility is not usually considered as    probable, and the second one is already included in modern models, that    adopt metallicity dependent stellar yields. Thus it stands to reason that    the dark matter halo may affect the gas infall rate or star formation    rate.,v
