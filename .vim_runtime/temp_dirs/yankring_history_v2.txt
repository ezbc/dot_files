The most common diagnostic diagram in the literature forthe optical regime is the one which makes use of easily-observable strong lines that are less affected by dust attenua-tion, i.e., [O iii]/Hβ vs. [N ii]/Hα (Baldwin et al. 1981),v
effects of a star formation rate and an infall of gas, both vary-ing with galactocentric radius of galaxies. In most recent timeschemical evolution has been included in modern cosmologicalsimulation codes, which already obtain spiral disks as observed,finding radial gradients of abundances which reproduce the data(Pilkington et al. 2012). It has been demonstrated Gibson et al.(2013), that the existence and evolution of these radial gradientsis, as expected, very dependent on the star formation and infallprescriptions included in the simulations.,v

Of course, this habitable zone, according to the picture seen, will extend as the sun gets brighter. This gives hope to the future where one day where water can potentially exist on planet Mars. The atmosphere, however, is also a factor when it comes to determining if water can exist in its liquid state. Mars is a relatively low atmospheric planet with its lowest pressure occurring at 30 Pa, its highest at 1,155 Pa, and an average of 600 Pa. This is a relatively low atmospheric pressure in comparison to Earth. For example, the highest pressure on Mars is approximately equal to pressure 35 kilometers above earth (Wikipedia). This causes for water to also not be possible in its current state. ,V
In fact, as explained byGoetz & Koeppen (1992a), there are only 4 possible ways to cre-ate a radial abundance gradient: 1) A radial variation of the ini-tial mass function (IMF); 2) A variation of the stellar yields withgalactocentric radius; 3) A star formation rate (SFR) changingwith the radius; 4) A gas infall rate variable with radius. The firstpossibility is not usually considered as probable, and the secondone is already included in modern models, that adopt metallic-ity dependent stellar yields. Thus, from the seminal works ofLacey & Fall (1985a), Guesten & Mezger (1982) and Clayton(1987), most of numerical chemical evolution models (e.g.Diaz & Tosi 1984; Matteucci & Francois 1989a; Ferrini et al.1992; Carigi 1994; Prantzos & Aubert 1995; Molla et al. 1996;Chiappini et al. 1997; Boissier & Prantzos 1999b) explain theexistence of the radial gradient of abundances by the combined,v
    In particular     \citet{martel13} found that the global SFR (especially along the bar) and    the large-scale flow of enriched gas play a major role in the metallicity    gradients of spirals.    \citet{portinari10} found by investigating rotation curves in the framework    of variable mass to light ratio of stellar discs, they confirm the scenario    obtained with the constant Mstar/L assumption: a dark matter halo with a    shallow core, an inner baryon-dominated region, and a larger proportion of    dark matter in smaller objects.    \citet{dicintio14} used simulations. The main result is a clear dependence    of the inner slope of the dark matter density profile on the    stellar-to-halo mass ratio.    \citet{dicintio14b} introduce a mass dependent density profile to describe    the distribution of dark matter within galaxies, which takes into account    the stellar-to-halo mass dependence of the response of dark matter to    baryonic processes    \citet{tissera13} investigate the chemical and kinematic properties of the    diffuse stellar haloes of six simulated Milky-Way-like galaxies from the    Aquarius Project. The observed abundance gradients in the inner-halo    regions are influenced by both the level of chemical enrichment and the    relative contributions from each stellar subpopulation. Steeper abundance    gradients in the inner-halo regions are related to contributions from the    disc-heated and endo-debris stars, which tend to be found at lower binding    energies than debris stars.     \citet{martel13} The main result of this work is therefore that the    observed enrichment in the centres of barred galaxies is not dominated by    in situ enrichment by stars formed in the centre. The central metallicity    does not originate exclusively from central stars. Instead, the global SFR    (especially along the bar) and the large-scale flow of enriched gas play a    major role.    \citet{spavone10} We used high resolution spectra in the optical and    near-infrared wavelength range to study the abundance ratios and    metallicities of the HII regions associated with the polar disk in    NGC4650A, in order to put constraints on the formation of the polar disk    through cold gas accretion along a filament; this might be the most    realistic way by which galaxies get their gas. We have compared the    measured metallicities for the polar structure in NGC4650A with those of    different morphological types and we have found that they are similar to    those of late-type galaxies: such results is consistent with a polar disk    formed by accretion from cosmic web filaments of external cold gas.    \citet{mott13} We compute the abundance gradients along the disc of the    Milky Way by means of the two-infall model: in particular, the gradients of    oxygen and iron and their temporal evolution. First, we explore the effects    of several physical processes which influence the formation and evolution    of abundance gradients. They are (i) the inside-out formation of the disc,    (ii) a threshold in the gas density for star formation, (iii) a variable    star formation efficiency along the disc, (iv) radial flows and their speed    and (v) different total surface mass density (gas plus stars) distributions    for the halo.     \citet{fu13} used simulations to show radial gas inflow has little    influence on gas-phase and stellar metallicity gradients, which are    affected much more strongly by the fraction of metals that are directly    injected into the halo gas, rather than mixed with the cold gas. Metals    ejected out of the galaxy in early epochs result in late infall of    pre-enriched gas and flatter present-day gas-phase metallicity gradients.,V
